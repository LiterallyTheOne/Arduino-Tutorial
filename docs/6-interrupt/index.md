# Interrupt

## Introduction

In the previous session, we learned how to work with analog values in **Arduino Uno**.
In this session we will learn about one of the most important aspects of microcontrollers,
which is called **Interrupt**.
We have different kinds of **Interrupts**, but in this tutorial, we are going to focus on the **External Interrupt**,
which we will explain very soon.

## Conclusion
